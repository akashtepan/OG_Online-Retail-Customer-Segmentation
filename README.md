# Online Retail Customer Segmentation

## Project Summary

The project focuses on a UK-based non-store online retail business that specializes in unique all-occasion gifts. The goal is to uncover the major customer segments of the business using a transaction data set that contains information on customer transactions, such as invoice number, product code, description, quantity, invoice date, unit price, customer ID, and country. By analyzing this data, we aim to identify different customer segments based on their purchasing behavior and characteristics, such as demographics, purchasing frequency, and average spend. The insights gained from this analysis can help the business optimize its marketing and sales strategies to better serve its customers, ultimately improving customer satisfaction and increasing revenue.
